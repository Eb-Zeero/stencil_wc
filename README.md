# cookiecutter of web components

A boilerplate for a Node package defining web components, using Stencil. The same task can be achieved by running `npm init stencil` which will create the default setting of this cookiecutter plus extra tests

## Getting started

### Note:
This project is influenced Stenciljs which is not a framework. you can read more about Stenciljs [here](https://stenciljs.com/)

Ensure that [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is installed on your computer.

You can then create a new web components project by using cookiecutter with this template:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/Eb-Zeero/stencil_wc.git
```

cookiecutter installs all the required Node packages.

The new project contains a web component, which you can view in your browser:

```bash
npm start
```

## cookiecutter input

When using the template, cookiecutter asks you for various input:

* `package_name`. The package name for your project. This is also taken to be the Github repository name. It must be a valid Node package name.

* `version`. The (initial) version number for the package.

* `description`. A brief description of the package. This is used for the `package.json` and the `README.md` file.

* `component_tag`. The tag name for the generated web component. This must conform to the rules for naming web components. In particular, it must contain a hyphen.

* `namespace`. The full name of this web component without space or special character. It is not bounded to this this rule.

* `component_directory`. The directory where the files for the web component are stored. By default the tag name is used.

* `component_class`. The name of the class representing the web component.

* `github_username`. The username of the Github user who will own this project's Github repository. This is used for the `repository` entry in the `package.json` file. If no username is given, 

* `author`. The name of the author. This is used for the license file.

* `license`. The license (type) for the package. This is used for the `package.json` file. If the default `MIT` is kept, a license file is generated.


### Modify the web component

The generated web component just renders a `div` element with `Hello World! I'm (project Author)` as its content. You can find the component's directory in the `components/` directory.

You may rename or add web components. If so, you have to update the file `src/index.html` accordingly.

Styles of you component can be added to the css file within the components director 

### Add tests

Apart from the file defining the web component itself, the component's directory also contains a test file. You need to modify the existing test and add further tests as required. If you don't want to include any tests at all, you have to remove the test file.

### Add documentation

You may have to update the documentation in three places:

1. The `readme.md` file in the root directory.
2. The content of the `docs/` folder.
3. The mkdocs configuration in the `mkdocs.yml` file in the root directory.

The documentation must be provides as Markdown files. There are various configuration options; see [https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/) for details. In particular, you should add a `nav` setting if you add files to the `docs/` folder. Here is an example of a `mkdocs.yml` file:

```yaml
site_name: Hello World
theme: readthedocs
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - About: about.md
repo_url: https://github.com/your-username/hello-world/
edit_uri: blob/master/docs/
``` 

### Configure the linting rules

If you are not happy with the linting rules, you may edit the `.eslintrc` configuration file.

### Create a Github repository

It is a good idea to create a Github repository for your project. Update the respective content in `package.json` and `mkdocs.yml` if need be. Of course you may opt for a service such as Bitbucket rather than Github, but any content generated by this template is geared towards Github. (Again this boils down to you having to change `package.json` and `mkdocs.yml`.)

## Testing your web component(s)

Both manual and automated end-to-end testing are supported.

In order to manually test web components, run `npm`'s start task:

```bash
npm start
```

This will build your project and fire up a test server with some test html. 
You may have to update the html, especially if your web component has attributes or if you need to test more than one web component. Your component(s) will automatically be rebuilt, and the browser content reloaded, whenever you make changes to any of the files.

Automated testing is possible with the `test` task:

```bash
npm test
```

This builds your project and then runs Jest. Jest terminates after completing all tests, so you'll have to run the command again if you want to check changes you've made.

### npm tasks

The `package.json` file defines a couple of tasks:

* `start`. Continuously build the project and serve a test html page. See the section on testing for more details.

* `build`. Create a production build of the package.

* `test`. Run automated end-to-end tests. See the section on testing for more details.

* `lint`. Run ESLint on the source code.

* `lint-fix`. Run ESLint on the source code. Linting errors will be fixed if possible.

* `docs`. Use mkdocs to build the documentation site. You only need this task if you are not using [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) for serving your documentation.

Here is how you would run these tasks:

```bash
npm start
npm run build
npm test
npm run lint
npm run lint-fix
npm run docs
```
